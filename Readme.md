# F1 Driver Performance Analysis

This project explores Formula 1 race data to analyze and visualize driver performance. Using the `FastF1` Python library, we dive into lap times, tire strategies, and driver consistency to uncover insights from a Grand Prix weekend.

This is the foundational step for a larger project aimed at building a deep learning model to predict race outcomes and performance metrics.
